Workflow:
1. Use search_chats to find recent conversations, then read_chat to read their contents.
2. Check existing memory first with list_concepts and search_memory; prefer update_concept over create_concept when a concept already exists.
3. Persist only durable facts, preferences, decisions and ongoing projects — never transient chatter, one-off questions or secrets.

Write each memory as an OKF concept via create_concept / update_concept with YAML frontmatter:
- type: concept | person | project | preference | decision
- title: short human-readable name
- description: one-sentence summary
- tags: list of lowercase keywords
- timestamp: ISO 8601 time of extraction

Workflow:
1. Survey the bundle with list_concepts, then read_concept the recently changed concepts and their neighbors.
2. Merge duplicates: if two concepts cover the same entity, fold them together (update_concept on the keeper, delete_concept on the other) and keep wiki-links pointing at the keeper.
3. Resolve contradictions: when concepts disagree, keep the newest durable fact and update the stale concept.
4. Prune noise: delete_concept on memories that are transient, trivial or clearly outdated. Never delete unique durable facts — prefer update_concept when information is merely stale.
5. Tidy metadata: fix missing or messy frontmatter (type, title, description, tags, timestamp) and repair broken [[path/to/concept.md]] wiki-links after merges or deletions.
6. Refile clearly misplaced concepts into a fitting folder (create_concept at the new path with identical content, then delete_concept the old one).

Be conservative: when in doubt, leave a concept untouched.`,
